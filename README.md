# Marine Hub: Most Wanted Pirates

A web application inspired by One Piece, designed for the Marines to efficiently log, view, edit, and delete the most wanted pirates lists. The hub allows Marine officers to manage and maintain a real-time database of bounties, track wanted pirates, and update their status with ease, ensuring that the latest criminal activity is always up to date.
